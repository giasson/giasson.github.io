                "To launch the fall cultural season, Skol presents 11, the first solo exhibition of the Montreal-based conceptual artist Steve Giasson.",
                "Eleven years after the 9/11 terrorist strikes, one has to admit that the West has not recovered from the event: simmering, now nameless wars in which the Coalition has engaged, a global economic crisis, a climate of fear and distrust, all testify to the fact that our civilization has been shaken.",
                "As part of 11, conceptual artist Steve Giasson multiplies borrowed materials, extensions, reflections, but also media, to propose a modest appraisal of the aftershocks of this “horrific spectacle” (Mondzain, 2002, p.9) and other foreboding signs and of its complex relationships with the image. He presents six works that attempt, through looped images and a growing proliferation of commentary about them, to “revisit [not just] the event itself, but rather its consequences, its mediatised manifestations.” (Enwezor, 2008. p.29)"
